    <h2>Jalen Broussard</h2>

<p>
I am seeking a career change after working in the retail industry. My hobbies include shopping, thrifting, football and supporting my brother as his biggest fan. He is currently a running back at Michigan State University!
</p>

    <h2>Montae Edwards</h2>

<p>
I started with Techbridge seeking a career change after being a nurse for the past 8 years. My hobbies include sports (I am a <strong>huge<strong> Georgia Bulldog fan) and documentaries of pretty much any kind. However, the true crime genre has a hold on me. My long term goals consist of having a successful career as a web developer and retiring to live in Costa Rica.

     <h2>Charmaine</h2>
    <img src = "linkedinpfp 2.jpg" alt = "Headshot of Charmaine">
    <p>I am currently enrolled in the TechBridge Front End Web Development to become a Front End Web Developer. I hope to eventually get into UX Design but wanted to understand how websites are made beforehand. After finsihing the program, I hope to land a job and continue to strengthen my skills as an engineer. I'd also like to help others like me coming from a low-income background make a career change in a lucrative field. My hobbies outside of coding include sewing, crocheting, and graphic design.</p>
    What do you have in common?
    <br>
    We all want to become more involved with tech and develop the skills to navigate the various paths that front end development can provide.
